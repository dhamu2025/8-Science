Very Short Answer,What is the SI unit of length?,metre
Very Short Answer,What is measurement?,Comparison of an unknown quantity with a known fixed standard quantity
Very Short Answer,Name any two derived quantities,Area and Volume
Very Short Answer,What is the SI unit of time?,second
Very Short Answer,Define unit,A definite amount of a physical quantity adopted as a standard of measurement

Short Answer,What are fundamental quantities? Give examples.,Fundamental quantities are the quantities which cannot be expressed in terms of any other physical quantities. Examples: length mass time temperature electric current luminous intensity and amount of substance
Short Answer,What is the need for measurement?,Measurement helps us to compare describe and understand the physical quantities in our daily life. It helps in scientific studies and technological developments
Short Answer,Define SI system.,The International System of Units (SI) is the modern form of the metric system. It is universally accepted system of measurement
Short Answer,What are derived quantities? Give examples.,Derived quantities are those quantities which can be expressed in terms of fundamental quantities. Examples: area volume speed acceleration force and pressure
Short Answer,Write a short note on length.,Length is the distance between two points. The SI unit of length is metre (m). It is a fundamental quantity

Detailed Answer,Explain the different types of physical quantities with examples.,Physical quantities are classified into two types: 1) Fundamental quantities - These cannot be expressed in terms of other physical quantities (e.g. length mass time temperature electric current luminous intensity amount of substance) 2) Derived quantities - These can be expressed in terms of fundamental quantities (e.g. area volume speed acceleration force pressure). Each physical quantity has its own SI unit for measurement
Detailed Answer,Describe the importance of measurement in daily life.,Measurement plays a vital role in our daily life: 1) It helps us compare and understand physical quantities 2) Essential for commerce and trade 3) Used in scientific research and technological development 4) Helps maintain standards and quality 5) Important in construction and manufacturing 6) Used in medical diagnosis and treatment 7) Necessary for cooking and food preparation 8) Critical in sports and athletics

Higher Order Thinking,If you were to design a new system of measurement what fundamental quantities would you choose and why?,This is an open-ended question that requires critical thinking. A good answer would consider: 1) What quantities are truly independent 2) Which ones are most useful for deriving other quantities 3) How easily they can be standardized 4) Their practical applications in daily life and science
Higher Order Thinking,How would our understanding of the physical world be different if we had no standardized system of measurement?,This question explores the importance of standardized measurements. Without them: 1) Scientific collaboration would be difficult 2) Technology development would be inconsistent 3) International trade would be complicated 4) Quality control would be challenging 5) Scientific discoveries might not be reproducible
