True or False,Force acting on a given area is called pressure.,True
True or False,A moving body comes to rest due to friction alone.,True
True or False,A body will sink if the weight of the body is greater than the buoyant force.,True
True or False,One atmosphere is equivalent to 1 00 000 newton force acting on one square metre.,True
True or False,Rolling friction is slightly greater than the sliding friction.,False (Rolling friction is slightly lesser than the sliding friction)
True or False,Friction is the only reason for the loss of energy.,True
True or False,Liquid pressure decreases with the decrease of depth.,True
True or False,Using barometers one can measure the height of a building.,False (Using barometers one can measure the atmospheric pressure)
True or False,Surface tension causes the spherical nature of a water drop.,True
True or False,Viscosity depends on the pressure of a liquid.,True

Match the Following,Force:Push or pull,Pressure:Force per unit area,Friction:Opposing force,Thrust:Normal force,Viscosity:Resistance to flow

Assertion & Reason,Assertion: Force is defined as a push or pull acting on a body. Reason: CGS unit of force is newton.,The assertion is true but the reason is false
Assertion & Reason,Assertion: Friction always opposes the motion. Reason: Whenever one surface moves or tries to move over another surface the force of friction starts acting on the surfaces.,The assertion is false but the reason is true
Assertion & Reason,Assertion: The pressure at the bottom of the sea is lesser than that near the surface. Reason: The pressure exerted by a liquid depends upon the depth of the liquid and density of the liquid.,The assertion is false but the reason is true
Assertion & Reason,Assertion: We can live very happily if friction is not present in nature. Reason: Aeroplane shape is streamlined to reduce the effort of frictional force.,The assertion is false but the reason is true
Assertion & Reason,Assertion: There is danger of a vehicle skidding on a wet road. Reason: The tyres of the vehicle lose their grip on the road due to increase in friction due to presence of water on the road.,The assertion is true but the reason is false

Very Short Answer,Write the SI unit of force.,Newton (N)
Very Short Answer,Write the SI unit of pressure.,Pascal (Pa)
Very Short Answer,Mention the factors that the effect of a force depend.,1. Magnitude of the force 2. The area over which it acts
Very Short Answer,Name the material which is used to reduce friction.,Lubricant
Very Short Answer,What is lateral pressure?,Liquid exerts pressure on the walls of the container also. This is called lateral pressure
Very Short Answer,What is thrust?,The force acting normally on a surface is called thrust
Very Short Answer,Name an instrument used to measure the difference in the liquid pressure.,Barometer
Very Short Answer,Mention the two types of forces.,1. Contact force 2. Non-contact force
Very Short Answer,State whether the liquids and gases also exerts pressure.,Yes both the liquids and gases also exerts pressure
Very Short Answer,In 'tug of war' when two teams pull equally hard then what happens?,The rope does not move in any direction

Short Answer,Define force. Mention its SI unit.,Force is that which changes or tends to change: 1. The state of rest or 2. The state of uniform motion of a body or 3. The direction of a moving body or 4. The shape of a body. SI unit is Newton
Short Answer,Does the palm apply any force on the ball when we place our palm in front of a moving ball?,Yes when we place our palm in front of a moving ball then the palm apply a force on the moving ball and stop it
Short Answer,Briefly explain how do we experience force in our daily life.,We experience force in many actions like hitting or catching objects. Moving balls stop after sometime and change direction when hit by a bat. When we compress a spring its shape and size changes
Short Answer,Can you lift or push a book lying on a table without touching it?,No we cannot lift or push a book lying on a table without touching it because it is a type of contact forces
Short Answer,Explain the effect on the pressure when area on which it is applied decreases.,Pressure is inversely proportional to the area on which force is applied. Therefore with the decrease in area the pressure increases

Detailed Answer,Explain how friction can be minimised.,"1. Using lubricants: Substances like grease coconut oil graphite castor oil etc. fill up gaps in irregular surfaces providing a smooth layer preventing direct contact between rough surfaces. 2. Using ball bearings: Since rolling friction is smaller than sliding friction sliding is replaced by rolling with ball bearings like in cycle hubs"
Detailed Answer,Describe an experiment to prove that the pressure in a liquid increases with depth.,"Take a plastic bottle. Punch three holes on its side at different heights. Pour water and observe flow through holes. Water from lowest hole comes with greatest force falling farthest showing pressure increases with depth"

Higher Order Thinking,Why is it not advisable to take a fountain pen while travelling in an aeroplane?,"Fountain pens balance atmospheric pressure at sea level. At higher altitudes atmospheric pressure decreases making internal pen pressure greater causing leakage"
Higher Order Thinking,Why do scuba divers wear a special suit while they go into deep sea levels?,"Pressure deep under sea is so high that without specially designed suits the water pressure would crush their body"
Higher Order Thinking,Why are rain drops spherical in nature?,"Surface tension pulls water into spherical shape as sphere has minimum surface area for given volume. In absence of other forces including gravity all liquid drops would be approximately spherical"
