True or False,We can see things around us only when the light reflected by them reaches our eyes.,True
True or False,Light is a form of energy and it travels in a straight line.,True
True or False,The periscope is an optical device with a polished surface that reflects the light falling on it.,"False. Correct statement: The mirror is an optical device with a polished surface that reflects the light falling on it."
True or False,Curved mirrors have surfaces that are spherical cylindrical parabolic and ellipsoid.,True
True or False,Curved mirrors form the perfect image of an object.,"False. Correct statement: Plane mirrors form the perfect image of an object."
True or False,Curved mirrors produce images that are either enlarged or diminished.,True
True or False,A thin layer of molten aluminium or silver is used for coating glass plates that will then become mirrors.,True
True or False,The most common example of a convex mirror is the make-up mirror.,"False. Correct statement: The most common example of a concave mirror is the make-up mirror."
Assertion & Reason,Assertion: A ray incident along normal to the mirror retraces its path. Reason: In reflection angle of incidence is always equal to angle of reflection.,Both assertion and reason are true and the reason is the correct explanation of the assertion
Assertion & Reason,Assertion: Convex mirrors are used as rear view mirror in vehicles for observing traffic at our back. Reason: A convex mirror has a much larger field of view.,Both assertion and reason are true and the reason is the correct explanation of the assertion
Assertion & Reason,Assertion: The mirrors used in search lights are parabolic and not concave spherical. Reason: In concave spherical mirror the image formed is always virtual.,"The assertion is true but the reason is false. Correct explanation: In search lights we need an intense parallel beam of light. If a source is placed at the focus of a concave spherical mirror only paraxial rays are rendered parallel. Due to large aperture of mirror marginal rays give a divergent beam. But in case of parabolic mirror when source is at the focus beam of light produced over the entire cross-section of the mirror is a parallel beam."
Very Short Answer,How does the light travel?,The light travels along straight lines.
Very Short Answer,What is reflection of light?,The bouncing back of light when it falls on smooth surface is called reflection.
Very Short Answer,What is mirror?,The mirror is an optical device with a polished surface that reflects the light falling on it.
Very Short Answer,What type of image is formed by a concave mirror?,Real and inverted image. If the object is placed very close to the mirror then the image is virtual and erect.
Very Short Answer,What is rainbow?,The rainbow is seen as a large area in the sky with many colours.
Very Short Answer,Name the triangular piece of glass that splits white light into different colours.,Prism
Very Short Answer,What is the composition of sunlight?,Sunlight is a mixture of seven colours.
Very Short Answer,Light bends as it passes from one medium to another. What is this phenomenon called?,Refraction of light
Very Short Answer,Name the two types of spherical mirrors.,"1. Concave mirror
2. Convex mirror"
Short Answer,Light travels fastest in vacuum. Why?,Light travels fastest in vacuum than any other medium because there is no obstruction to the passage of light in vacuum.
Short Answer,Distinguish between real and virtual images.,"Real image: Type of image which can be obtained on a screen is called a real image
Virtual image: An image which cannot be obtained on a screen is called a virtual image."
Short Answer,State any two uses of concave mirrors.,"1. It is used as a reflector in torches light houses head lights of vehicles etc. as it diverges the rays of light.
2. A dentist uses a concave mirror to obtain a magnified image of the teeth of the patient."
Short Answer,A convex rear view mirror is preferred over a plane mirror in a car. Why?,Since convex mirror forms a smaller and virtual image it can be used to see a much larger area than the area visible by a plane mirror.
Short Answer,What type of image is formed by a concave mirror?,The image formed by a concave mirror is real and inverted. If the object is placed very near to the mirror then the image formed is virtual and erect.
Short Answer,Why do we need a shiny surface for reflection?,The extent of reflection depends upon the shine and smoothness of the surface. More is the shine and smoothness of the surface more will be the reflection.
Detailed Answer,Differentiate between regular and irregular reflection.,"Regular reflection:
1. When a beam of light falls on a smooth surface it gets reflected. After reflection the reflected rays will be parallel to each other.
2. The angle of incidence and the angle of reflection of each ray will be equal.
3. The law of reflection is obeyed and thus a clear image is formed.
4. This reflection is called 'regular reflection' or 'specular reflection'.
Example: Reflection of light by a plane mirror and reflection of light from the surface of still water.

Irregular reflection:
1. In the case of a body having a rough or irregular surface each region of the surface is inclined at different angles.
2. When light falls on such a surface the light rays are reflected at different angles.
3. The angle of incidence and the angle of reflection of each ray are not equal.
4. The law of reflection is not obeyed and thus the image is not clear.
Example: Reflection of light from a wall."
Detailed Answer,Explain the working of a periscope.,"1. It is an instrument used for viewing bodies or ships which are over and around another body or a submarine.
2. It is based on the principle of the law of reflection of light.
3. It consists of a long outer case and inside this case mirrors or prisms are kept at each end inclined at an angle of 45°.
4. Light coming from the distant body falls on the mirror at the top end of the periscope and gets reflected vertically downward.
5. This light is reflected again by the second mirror kept at the bottom so as to travel horizontally and reach the eye of the observer.
6. In some complex periscopes optic fibre is used instead of mirrors for obtaining a higher resolution.
7. The distance between the mirrors also varies depending on the purpose of using"
Higher Order Thinking,Imagine that parallel rays are incident on an irregular surface. Are the rays reflected from the surface parallel to each other?,No the reflected rays from irregular surface are in different direction.
Higher Order Thinking,A safety vest helps to keep the workers who are working by the roadside safe. This especially so during the nights. Why?,"The reflectors on the safety vest reflect light into the motorists eyes.
This helps to alert the motorists of the wearer's presence on the road."
Higher Order Thinking,What is the difference between virtual images of an object formed by a concave mirror and a convex mirror?,The virtual image of an object formed by a concave mirror is always magnified one but the image formed by a convex mirror is always diminished one.
Higher Order Thinking,What is a virtual image? Give one situation where a virtual image is formed.,The image formed by the plane mirror appears behind it. We cannot however touch it. Also the image of the object cannot be obtained on a screen whether it is held in front of the mirror or behind it. Such type of images are not real. They are virtual images.
Higher Order Thinking,If all objects around us were to reflect light in a regular way what problem might we face?,"1. Irregular reflection is what makes us see all the objects and everything around us.
2. If light were to get regularly reflected then every object would act like a mirror and our surroundings would be illuminated.
3. This would have a blinding effect on eyes making it harder for us to see."
