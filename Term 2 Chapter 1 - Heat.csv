Fill in the Blanks,When we heat water the force of attraction decreases and the ice cubes becomes ________.,Water
Fill in the Blanks,________ is the only matter on the Earth that can be found naturally in all three states.,Water
True or False,The applied heat energy can be realized as an increase in the average kinetic energy of the molecules.,True
True or False,The dimensions of a substance are increased if the temperature of the substance is decreased.,"False. Correct statement: The dimensions of a substance are increased if the temperature of the substance is increased."
True or False,The process of converting a substance from solid to gas is called condensation.,"False. Correct statement: The process of converting a substance from solid to gas is called sublimation."
True or False,Convection is the process by which the thermal energy flows in solids.,"False. Correct statement: Convection is the process by which the thermal energy flows in liquids and gases."
True or False,The amount of heat gained by a substance is equal to the product of its mass and latent heat.,True
True or False,In a thermos flask the silvered walls reflect and radiate the heat to the outside.,"False. Correct statement: In a thermos flask the silvered walls reflect radiated heat back to the liquid in the bottle."
Assertion & Reason,Assertion: When a very hot liquid is poured into a thick glass tumbler it cracks. Reason: Unequal expansion of the inner and outer glass walls causes the glass to crack.,Both assertion and reason are true and the reason is the correct explanation of the assertion.
Assertion & Reason,Assertion: Radiation is a process of transfer of heat in which a material medium is not necessary. Reason: The heat from the sun reaches us through millions of miles of empty space by convection.,The assertion is true but the reason is false.
Assertion & Reason,Assertion: Temperature is the measure of the heat energy. Reason: Energy is the capacity to do work.,Assertion is false but the reason is true
Very Short Answer,What is transfer of heat?,If heat energy is supplied to any substance it will be transferred from one part of the substance to another part.
Very Short Answer,Define radiation.,Radiation is defined as the way of heat transfer from one place to another in the form of electromagnetic waves.
Very Short Answer,Why do we wear woolen clothes in winter?,"1. The fibers of wool have the property of trapping air in between them.
2. In trapping the air woolen clothes do not allow the heat to flow away from the body which would then become cold.
3. Besides wool is poor conductor of heat. So this property further prevents heat from leaving the body."
Short Answer,What are the effects of heat?,"1. Expansion
2. Increase in temperature
3. Change in state"
Short Answer,What are the applications of convection in daily life?,"1. Formation of land breeze and sea breeze is due to convection of air.
2. Wind flows from one region to another region by convection.
3. In hot air balloons heat is transferred by convection and so the balloon raises.
4. In refrigerators cool air moves downward and replaces the hot air because of convection."
Short Answer,What are the applications of radiation in daily life?,"1. Heat energy from the Sun reaches the Earth by radiation.
2. While standing near fire we feel the heat which is transferred as radiation.
3. Black surfaces absorb heat radiation. So that the bottom of the cooking vessels are painted black.
4. White color reflects heat radiation. That's why we are advised to wear white cloth during summer."
Detailed Answer,Explain the working of thermos flask.,"1. A thermos flask has double walls which are evacuated.
2. It is silvered on the inside.
3. The vacuum between the two walls prevents heat being transferred from the inside to the outside by conduction and convection.
4. With very little air between the walls there is almost no transfer of heat from the inner wall to the outer wall or vice versa.
5. Conduction can only occur at the points where the two walls meet at the top of the bottle and through an insulated support at the bottom.
6. The silvered walls reflect radiated heat back to the liquid in the bottle."
Higher Order Thinking,Why does the bottom of a lake not freeze in severe winter even when the surface is all frozen?,"Lakes don't completely freeze because the ice (and eventually snow) on the surface acts to insulate the water below. To freeze water into ice a large quantity of heat is to be withdrawn. This heat cannot be withdrawn easily due to the insulating properties of ice and snow on the surface."
