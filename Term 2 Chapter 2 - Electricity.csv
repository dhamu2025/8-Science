Very Short Answer,Name the process which shows the chemical effect of electric current?,Electroplating
Very Short Answer,What are electrodes?,The metal rods dipped in liquids to which cells are attached
Very Short Answer,Who discovered static electricity or lightning in clouds?,Benjamin Franklin in 1752
Very Short Answer,What are charged objects?,The objects which acquire a small charge on rubbing
Very Short Answer,What do you mean by earthing?,The process of transferring of charge from a charged object to the earth
Short Answer,Why is a layer of zinc coated over iron?,Zinc prevents iron from rust and corrosion
Short Answer,Name the effect of current responsible for the glow of the bulb in an electrical circuit.,Heating effect of electric current
Short Answer,Name a few appliances which work on the basis of heating effect of current.,Bulb iron heater electric kettles electric cookers electric fuse
Short Answer,What are the essential components of an electric circuit?,Electric cell bulb switch battery and connecting wires
Short Answer,How can you save yourselves from lightning?,"1. We should remain in the covered area. 2. We should not use wired telephones during lightning."
Detailed Answer,State some advantages of electroplating.,"1. It protects the metal from corrosion and rusting. 2. It is used to coat desired metal on other objects. 3. It can make more reactive metal like iron. 4. Coating of chromium on the metal gives luster to the objects."
Detailed Answer,Write the differences between conductors and insulators.,"Conductors: Materials which allow the electric current to pass through them (Example: All metals Salt water). Insulators: Materials do not allow the current to pass through them (Example: Dry wood plastics rubber glass)"
Detailed Answer,What are anodes and cathodes?,"1. In the process of electrolysis the electrode which is connected to the positive terminal of the battery is called anode. 2. The electrode which is connected to the negative terminal of the battery is called cathode."
Detailed Answer,What will be the charges on silk and glass rod when they are rubbed against each other?,"1. When a glass rod is rubbed with silk piece the free electrons in the glass rod are transferred to silk piece. 2. It is because the free electrons in the glass rod are tightly bound as compared to that in silk piece. 3. Since the glass rod loses electrons it has a deficiency of electrons and hence acquires positive charge. 4. But silk piece has excess of electrons. 5. So it becomes negatively charged."
Higher Order Thinking,When a negatively charged glass rod is brought near another glass rod the rod will move apart. Give reason.,It is because both the glass rods are negatively charged. So they repel each other.
Higher Order Thinking,During lightning and thunder we should avoid standing in ground and open spaces. Why?,"During lightning and thunder we should avoid standing in ground and open spaces. You should make yourself as small as possible by squatting. It is however safe to stay inside a car because the car acts as a shield and protects us from the electric field generated by the storm."
Higher Order Thinking,You might have observed on a dry day that when you touch the screen of a television you get a slight shock. Why does it happen?,It happens because the television screen is charged and have static charges and when we touch with our hands which are uncharged the charges attract our hands and transfer through our hands and we get a small shock.
